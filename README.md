# Annette-Database

<h1>Accessing the Tables </h1>
<p> 1) Download Microsoft Sql Server Management Studio onto your computer and then open it. </p>
<p> 2) For Server type select "Database Engine". Get the Server name from Derek - its the same server name as the interface that we use as a front-end to Annette's Database. For Authentication: select "SQL Server Authentication". Get the login and password from Derek - also the same as the front-end interface. </p>
<p>3) Database should connect. To see the tables click on "Databases" on the left hand side, then "BYUStudies", and then "Tables" </p>
 <p>   4) Make sure to be careful working on this database as it is live and used by Annette on a regular basis. </p?
